# -Amplitude-Modulation-and-Demodulation-using-NumPy-and-Matplotlib

__Aim__: 

To implement and analyze amplitude modulation (AM) using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. 

__Apparatus Required__: 

Software: Python with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries 
Hardware: Personal Computer 

__Theory__: 

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique used in electronic communication, primarily for transmitting 
information via a radio carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of 
the message signal. The general form of an AM signal is: 


__Algorithm__:
1. Initialize Parameters: Set the values for carrier frequency, message frequency, and sampling frequency. 
2. Generate Time Axis: Create a time vector for the signal duration. 
3. Generate Message Signal: Define the message signal as a cosine wave. 
4. Generate Carrier Signal: Define the carrier signal as a cosine wave. 
5. Modulate Signal: Apply the AM formula to obtain the modulated signal. 
6. Plot the Signals: Use Matplotlib to plot the message signal, carrier signal, and modulated signal.

 __Result__:
The program successfully implemented Amplitude Modulation (AM) using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
